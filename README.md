# Implement of Database Signature-Indexes
# Aims
This project aims to give you an understanding of how database files are structured and accessed
how superimposed codeword (SIMC) signatures are implemented how concatenated codeword (CATC) signatures are implemented how partial-match retrieval searching is implemented using signatures the performance differences between different types of signatures

The goal is to build a simple implementation of a signature indexed file, including applications to create such files, insert tuples into them, and search for tuples based on partial-match retrieval queries.
